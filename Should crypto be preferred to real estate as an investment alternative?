As the world becomes more digitized, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed. Many investors are now considering crypto as an alternative to traditional investments such as real estate. While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, there are several reasons why crypto may be preferred over real estate as an investment alternative.

Firstly, crypto is highly liquid. Unlike real estate, which can take months or even years to sell, cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold instantly. This means that investors can quickly react to market changes and take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Additionally, crypto can be traded 24/7, allowing investors to monitor their investments at any time.

Secondly, crypto is decentralized. This means that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution,

Let us look at real estate as an investment and the risks associated with it.

Real estate is a popular investment option for many people due to its potential for long-term appreciation and the ability to generate passive income through rental properties. However, like any investment, there are risks associated with investing in real estate.

1. Market Risk: Real estate values can fluctuate based on market conditions, such as changes in interest rates, economic conditions, and supply and demand. A downturn in the real estate market can lead to a decrease in property values and rental income.

2. Property Risk: Real estate investments are subject to risks associated with the physical property, such as natural disasters, property damage, and maintenance costs. These risks can lead to unexpected expenses and a decrease in rental income.

3. Financing Risk: Real estate investments often require financing, which can expose investors to risks associated with interest rates, loan terms, and the ability to secure financing. A change in interest rates can increase the cost of borrowing and decrease the profitability of the investment.

4. Tenant Risk: Rental properties are subject to risks associated with tenants, such as non-payment of rent, property damage, and eviction costs. These risks can lead to a decrease in rental income and unexpected expenses.

5. Regulatory Risk: Real estate investments are subject to regulatory risks, such as changes in zoning laws, building codes, and tax laws. These risks can lead to unexpected expenses and a decrease in property values.

Overall, real estate can be a profitable investment option, but it is important to understand and manage the risks associated with it. Investors should conduct thorough research, seek professional advice, and have a solid understanding of the local real estate market before investing.

Advantages of cryptocurrency over real estate.
There are some advantages of cryptocurrency over real estate:

1. Liquidity - Cryptocurrencies can be traded instantly 24/7 on cryptocurrency exchanges, while selling or buying real estate can take a lot of time because of legal issues, paperwork, and negotiations.

2. Lower transaction costs - When buying or selling real estate, there are many fees and additional costs such as property transfer taxes, legal fees, and real estate agent commissions. In contrast, the transaction fees for cryptocurrency exchanges are typically much lower.

3. Global accessibility - Cryptocurrencies can be accessed by anyone anywhere in the world as long as they have an internet connection. On the contrary, real estate investing is limited to the local market unless you have significant financial resources.

4. Decentralization - Cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any government or financial institution, offering a higher level of privacy and security. Real estate transactions, being highly regulated, can sometimes pose a risk to the buyer.

5. Investment size - Cryptocurrency can be purchased in small fractions, making it more accessible for investors with lower incomes. Investing in real estate typically requires a large sum of capital.

However, real estate has its own advantages, including a proven long-term appreciation and a tangible asset that can be used for personal use or rental income. Both types of investments have their own level of risk-reward, and proper research and careful consideration should be made before any investment.

Applying cryptocurrency in real estate transaction.
The ideal combination of the two will be using stable coins (coins that have their value pegged to a stable currency) to purchase housing stocks.
This can be achieved through staking of cryptocurrency which after a while the staker gets rewarded with a mortgage plan payable with his annual interest rate of his cryptocurrency.
To achieve this, crypto giants like Binance and Ethereum are encouraged by the writer to get into the real estate business and acquire all kinds of real estate property like office lets, rental shops, restaurants and residential homes.
The commercial blocks will request a higher staking percentage because the staker will partake in the rent collection. A percentage will be agreed upon between the Blockchain company and the staker. The rent or income generated will be split 70%-30% where the staker gets 30% of revenue generated from the block (either as rent or passive income from customers), while the crypto company keeps the remaining 70% of generated income.
The staker whenever he wants to pull out his stake will have to give up his passive earning agreement to another staker who is willing to replace his stake.
This will give patronage boost to real estate developers, and also bring increased staking power to the Blockchain industry.
