The Blockchain industry brought with it many positive changes to the traditional third party transaction system.
A group of nodes interpreting transactions at the same time which are connected like a chain. This makes it almost impossible for one to hack or breach into the ecosystem because such a person will have to hack all the nodes running on the chain simultaneously to gain access.
However, with invention comes documentation. Most web3 technologies are documented in their whitePaper or litepaper. Some or the source codes are open source and iterable on their repository- which leaves us with the all important question, what are the measures in place to prevent malware manufacturing or shooting in the ecosystem?
Most viruses are manufactured by studying how their anti viruses work and then building something similar with a reverse technology


Ways of preventing future security breach occurrences:
Periodical security threat hackathons should be implemented for freelance hackers to test for security leakages in the Ethereum ecosystem. Subsequent improvements should be made after the security tests, and the troubleshooters should be rewarded with Eth.
Cybersecurity hackathons should be organized to look at possible security leakages on the network and give recommendations for tighter security protocols.
Employ the best performers to give better security to the network.
Hackathons are events where groups of people come together to collaboratively work on projects, typically involving software development. Participants often form teams and work on a project for a set period of time, usually ranging from a few hours to a few days. The ultimate goal of a hackathon is to produce a working prototype or solution to a specific problem or challenge.

Hackathons are often organized by companies, educational institutions, or non-profit organizations as a way to encourage innovation, creativity, and collaboration. They can focus on a variety of topics, including technology, social issues, or specific industries. Hackathons can also include workshops, talks, and networking events to help participants learn new skills and connect with others in their field.

Hackathons have become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in the tech industry, as a way to bring together developers, designers, and other professionals to work on new and innovative projects. They can be a great way to build skills, network, and showcase one's abilities to potential employers or clients.
Security checks should be ran on people that run nodes and edit them.
Consensual webcam monitoring and screen recording should they be subjected to before they are granted editors access to the ethereum repository 
Due and thorough security diligence checks should be carried out on potential investors so as to ensure they are not hacker sponsors, because most investors have a great influence on new protocol roll outs and how they can work. They can act as double informats for malware manufacturers.
Their communication should be obligatorily monitored and they should sign a code of conduct not to discuss any protocol upgrade outside of the ecosystem iteration committee.
