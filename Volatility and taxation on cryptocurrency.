Taxation can be defined as when a taxing authority, usually a government, levies or imposes a financial obligation on its citizens or residents. The term taxation applies to all types of involuntary levies, from income to capital gains to estate levies.(Investopedia,2023)
Tax is a useful source of government revenue generation. The government ideally uses taxes to pay for subsidies such as fuel subsidy, student loans and mortgage. A subsidy is a direct or indirect payments to individuals or firms usually in the form of a cash payment from the government or a targeted tax cut. In economic theory, subsidies can be used to offset market failures and externalities to achieve greater economic efficiency. Externalities are a consequence of an industrial or commercial activity which affects other parties without being reflected in market prices such as the pollination of surrounding crops by trees kept for honey. Example; general punishment for the crime of one person. 
The decentralized nature of cryptocurrency has so far sufficiently acted as a useful concrete alternative for traditional banking. The Blockchain giants (binance polygon and Ethereum) have acted as a sufficient ecosystem for thousands, and even millions of daily transactions. These block chain networks not necessarily need an office or a physical location because the operating mechanism has already been coded into place with smart contracts. They do not need a safe, a bullion van and security agencies to protect the assets because the assets are protected by the block chain.
Indeed, the only factor that will or is slowing down the fast adoption of cryptocurrency is the lack of acceptance, knowledge of operation and trust issues that exist between traditional bank users and aged people. 
With the right framework in place, gradual enlightenment and acceptance, cryptocurrency will enjoy more patronage. 
These factors have led us to ask you an important question. Should government impose tax on cryptocurrency?
Before we answer this question, we must ask ourselves, is cryptocurrency a real investment? can we consider it as a real asset?
An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation.(Investopedia,2023)
An asset is a resource with economic value that an individual,corporation or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit. There are of course various ways of building wealth in cryptocurrency so we can objectively call it an asset or an investment.
However, taxation comes with regulation and insurance for loss or indemnity. If the government wants to impose taxes on web3 firms or cryptocurrency industries, they must be prepared to indemnify the risks involved in the industry. 
We will first explore the various ways of revenue generation with cryptocurrency before we go ahead to explore the risks involved.

Recommendation
The writer recommends that if the government wants to tax crypto companies, they should provide emergency insurance funding to secure against potential asset loss due to the volatility of the crypto industry. Crypto industries can sign an agreement with the federal ministry of finance for deposit insurance levies every year, and the government in turn acts as an insurance firm to cover all range of possible asset loss for crypto holders in that registered crypto company. The government can act as a warranty provider.
